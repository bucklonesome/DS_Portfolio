Hank Williams,Lovesick Blues,"I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day, she said goodbye
Well Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick blues
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lord, I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Lord, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick blues",1949
Hank Snow,I'm Moving' On,"That big eight-wheeler, rollin' down the track
Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on.

That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, We're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free
And I'm movin' on.

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on.

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To deep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on.

I've told you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on.

You've swtched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
'Cause I'm movin on.

But someday baby, when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy, but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on.",1950
Lefty Frizzell,If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time,"If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll make all the night spots, dance, drink beer and wine
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

There ain't no use to tarry so let's start out tonight
We'll spread joy, oh boy, oh boy, and we'll spread it right
We'll have more fun, baby, all the way down the line
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
Bring along your Cadillac, leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

Yes, we'll go honky tonkin' make every club in town
We'll go to the park where it's dark, we won't fool around
But if you run short of money, I'll run short of time
'Cause you with no more money, honey, I've no more time

If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll make all the nightspots, dance, drink beer and wine
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time",1950
George Jones,White Lightning,"Well in North Carolina way back in the hills me and my old pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightnin till the sun went down
Then he'd fill up a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty mighty pleasin my pappy's corn squeezin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men revenoers too searchin for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin tryin' to book him but my pappy kept on cookin
(Whew white lightnin)

Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
And my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Light has started flashin thunder started krashin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men...

Well a city slicker came and he said I'm tough
I think I want to taste that powerful stuff
He took one slug and he drank it right down I heard him moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty mighty pleasin you'r pappy's corn squeezin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men. ",1959

Johnny Cash,Big River,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota)
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river)
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
Raised a few eyebrows and went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough; dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me ",1958
Dolly Parton,Jolene,"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Please don't take him even though you can

Johnn Paycheck,She's All I Got,"Well, I say, friend, don't take her, she's all I've got
Please, don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you, friend, don't take her, she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She is life when I wanna live
She's everything to me in life that life can give
She's my water when I need to drink
She's the first thought in my mind each time I try to think
Let me tell you now, friend...

She's my fingers when I want to feel
She's the only thing in life to me that's really real
She is love, she's all the love I know
She could kiss the ground in the wintertime and make the flower grow
Let me tell you now, friend...",1971
The Judds,Why Not Me,"You've been lookin' for love all around the world
Baby, don't you know this country girl's still free?
Why not me?
Well, you've finally come down to your old hometown
Your Kentucky girl's been waiting patiently
Why not me?
Why not me on a rainy day?
Why not me to love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me when the nights get cold?
Why not me when you're growin' old?
Why not me?
You've been searchin' from here to Singapore
Ain't it time that you notice the girl next door, baby
Why not me?
Oh, you had to see if the world was round
It's time that you learned how good settlin' down could be

Dwight Yoakam,"Guitars, Cadillacs","Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave
And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on",1986
George Strait,Amarillo By Morning,"Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
I'll be bucking at the county fair
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there

They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
Well I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind

Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine
I ain't rich, but Lord I'm free
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be ",1982
Alan Jackson,Don't Rock The Jukebox,"Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

I ain't got nothin'
Against rock & roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
Ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Ya don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song",1991
Vince Gill,Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away,"We've been up
All night long
Trying to solve a problem
Hell it's almost dawn
Ain't no time for sleepin'
If our love is wearin' thin
'Cause I ain't givin' up
And you ain't givin' in

Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
'Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

A wounded love
Walks a real thin line
And no communication
Will kill it every time
So open up your heart
Baby we can work it out
'Cause we've got the kind of love
People dream about

Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away
'Cause the life we've been livin'
Gets harder everyday
Don't let our love start slippin'
Love start slippin' away

It's past the point of right or wrong
Let's find a way to just hold on",1992
Patty Loveless,Blame It On Your Heart,"You've got a thing or two to learn about me baby
'Cause I ain't taking it no more and I don't mean maybe
You don't know right from wrong
Well the love we had is gone
So blame it on your lying, cheating, cold deadbeating,
Two-timing, double dealing
Mean mistreating, loving heart

And all I ever got from you was being lonely
Now that dream is laid to rest

The Chicks,There's Your Trouble,"Should've been different, but it wasn't different was it
Same old story and Dear John and so long
It should have fit like a glove
It should've fit like a ring, like a diamond ring
A token of a true love
Should've all worked out but it didn't
She should be here now but she isn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
Keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble
So now you're thinkin' bout all you're missin'
How deep you're sinkin' round and round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss, not such a big loss
Chalk it up for better luck
Could have been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
Keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble
Should have all worked out but it didn't
She should be here now but she isn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
Keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble

There's your trouble

Toby Keith,"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)","American girls and American guys
We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying
There's a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head
My daddy served in the army
Where he lost his right eye but he flew a flag out in our yard
Until the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy
In the land of the free
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly
Through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world
Like the fourth of July
Hey Uncle Sam, put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it's gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom start ringin' her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue
Justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you'll be sorry that you messed with
The U.S. of A.
'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass
It's the American way
Hey uncle sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist
And the eagle will fly it's gonna be hell

Billy Currington,People Are Crazy,"This old man and me
We're at the bar and we
We're havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
He said I fought two wars
Been married and divorced
What brings you to Ohio?
He said, damn if I know
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said, these damn things will kill me yet
But God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
Last call it's 2:00 a.m.
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy",2008
Luke Bryan,"Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day","… Whoa, whoa, mmm
… If I could make a livin' walkin' in the woods
You could bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in
… A huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

Sound of gravel when I back it up
And pullin' the string on a nine point nine two-stroke
Murphy
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

Why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good

I wish you said something mean maybe glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you look off somewhere if you catch me staring at you
Why can't you be cold like any old good ex would do
So-o-o
Why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good
Don't know what
You were thinkin'
You were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Keep wanting you
Why
Why
Why
Would you tell me that you call me up sometime?
Maybe we can get a drink and just catch up
Like that'd be enough
No, that ain't enough
Why you gotta
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good
Don't know what
You were thinkin'
You were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Out of all of the places
In this little town
Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down",2012
Morgan Wallen,Chasin You,"We used to chase that Chattanooga fray
Couple a kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple lamp
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now, what I was doing then
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
You always used to talk about L.A
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as guitar town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know better
Haven't given' up, I'm just on your radio
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you",2018
HARDY featuring Lainey Wilson,Wait In The Truck,"I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Working my way through a middle-of-June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was something in the headlights
It stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death, so I said
""Climb in, "" and then she climbed
Oh, yeah
Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happened to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through enough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And I asked her where he was
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under a seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again
When he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""
Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reaching for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under a seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again
When he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""
Whoa (whoa)
Have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me (hey), Lord
It's been 60 months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price, to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to, yeah
Wait in the truck (have mercy on me)
Just wait in the truck
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)
Wait in the truck (Lord, have mercy)
Just wait in the truck
have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck (please have me mercy)",2023
Luke Combs,The Kind Of Love We Make,"We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone
So whatcha say we cancel our plans?
Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man
Let's get some candles burnin'
And some records turnin'
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's movin'
Keep doin' what you're doin'
To me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
Well, there ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh
Besides turnin' round and lockin' the door
Watchin' your red dress fall to the floor
Let's get some candles burnin'
And some records turnin'
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's movin'
Keep doin' what you're doin'
To me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
Kind of love we make
So whatcha say we cancel our plans?
Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man
Let's get some candles burnin'
Some records turnin'
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's movin'
Keep doin' what you're doin'
To me all night long
Writin' our love song

Kane Brown,Like I Love Country Music,"Let's get it
Girl, you gone and done it to me
Hotter than a hoochie coochie
Got me like that first time I heard Alan Jackson Chattahoochee
I was never the same again, I'm a lifelong fan
Yes, I am
Baby, I love you like I love country music
You get me high as Willie girl
You get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like Johnny and June did
Yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music
'Cause I could never live without ya
Or my favorite songs about ya
Top to bottom perfect, you're like Brooks & Dunn's debut album
You got me feeling like I'm a brand new man

You get me high as Willie, girl
You get me gone as Jones

Baby, I love you like I love country music
If I was stranded on an island
Only way I could survive is
If I had you and that needle dropping on a vinyl
You get me high as Willie, girl
You get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line
Kinda like Johnny and June did
Yeah, let's do this

Merle Haggard,Swinging Doors,"This old smoke filled bar is something I'm not used to
But if gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'll be living
It's not much but I feel welcome here inside

And I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has got a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
Cause I'm always here at home till closing time

I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
And thanks to you I'm always here till closing time

And I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has got a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
Cause I'm always here at home till closing time

Yeah, I'm always here at home till closing time",1966
Willie Nelson,On The Road Again,"One two
One two three four

[Verse 1]
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

[Verse 2]
On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again",1980
Don Williams,Tulsa Time,"I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' to Arizona
Maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine
My baby said I was crazy
My mama called me lazy
I was gonna show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no foolin'
And I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well, you know I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well, there I was in Hollywood
Wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs
Guess I'm just a wastin' time
Well, then I got to thinkin'
Man, I'm really sinkin'
And I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin'
And nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I've been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I've been through
Livin' on Tulsa time",1978
