Joshua Hedley,Mr. Jukebox,"Feed me nickels, feed me dimes I'll play your favorite song just one more time I'm right here in the corner anytime you're feeling blue If you've got a new romance Well I've got the perfect dance If you need me I'll be here, I'm Mr. Jukebox This old barroom is my home It's the only one I've known I've been here since I was a little boy Singing songs that people know I watch them dancing to and fro While the music plays new lovers find their joy Feed me nickels, feed me dimes I'll play your favorite song just one more time I'm right here in the corner anytime you're feeling blue If you've got a new romance Well I've got the perfect dance If you need me I'll be here, I'm Mr. Jukebox Every night at closing time Johnny's down to his last dime Still he manages to buy another round I watch him clinging to the past As I play there stands the glass You can almost hear the teardrops hit the ground Feed me nickels, feed me dimes I'll play your favorite song just one more time I'm right here in the corner anytime you're feeling blue If you've got a new romance Well I've got the perfect dance If you need me I'll be here, I'm Mr. Jukebox",2018
Joshua Hedley,Neon Blue,"Well it was off to the races after that first dance I knew where we were headed if she'd give me the chance A little Friday night loving how could I lose Well I should've heard it coming like a train down the track Must've been in a hurry cause in no time flat She turned my honky tonk heart neon blue Neon blue, Neon blue That girl knew how to paint me a fool She turned my honky tonk heart neon blue If lonely was a color it would look like me Drinking double shots of whiskey while the jukebox sings Another song about heartache and an old bar stool Well the next thing I remember was red tail lights Yeah that long-gone baby with them deep green eyes She turned my honky tonk heart neon blue Neon blue, Neon blue That girl knew how to paint me a fool She turned my honky tonk heart neon blue Neon blue, Neon blue That girl knew how to paint me a fool She turned my honky tonk heart neon blue Bluer than the ocean, bluer than the skies Bluer than the sound of a steel guitar crying Why she up and left guess I'll never know why She turned my honky tonk heart neon blue",2022
Margo Price,Hurtin' (On The Bottle),"I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby, now I'm blind enough to see
Been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me
I was veering for the white line of the shoulder
Faded lights all cast upon the wall
Baby, I know we've been getting older
But you're never too old to learn to crawl
I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby, now I'm blind enough to see
Been drinking whiskey like it's water
That don't touch the pain you put on me
I met you with your thumb out in the alley
Oh, no one ever comes around here no more
Been looking for a peak inside the valley
Been searching for a key outside your door
I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby, now I'm blind enough to see
Been drinking whiskey like it's water
That don't touch the pain you put on me
Been riding high on low expectations
It's like singing loud with no one left to hear
Been drinking from the well of inspiration
But it's all falling on these wasted ears
I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby, now I'm blind enough to see
Been drinking whiskey like it's water
That don't touch the pain you put on me
I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby, now I'm blind enough to see
Been drinking whiskey like it's water
That don't touch the pain you put on me
Been drinking whiskey like it's water
That don't touch the pain you put on me",2016
Jason James,I've Been Drinkin' More,"I've been drinkin' more
Since you've been lovin' me less
Where you are tonight
Is anyone's guess
So to hide these tears
And drown my sorrows
I'll sit right here
Where the lights are low
And liquor flows
I've been driftin' here in a liquor-filled sea
Holdin' on to nothin' but a memory
Why, I never took you for the two-timing kind
But now you've got me swallowin' my pride
One shot at a time
I've been drinkin' more
Since you've been lovin' me less
Where you are tonight
Is anyone's guess
So to hide these tears
And drown my sorrows
I'll sit right here
Where the lights are low
And liquor flows
I thought I heard someone speak your name
He's sittin' right next to me doin' the same old thing
I could pretend that he ain't talkin' about you
But starin' me in the face is a hundred-and-one proof
I've been drinkin' more
Since you've been lovin' me less
Where you are tonight
Is anyone's guess
So to hide these tears
And drown my sorrows
I'll sit right here
Where the lights are low
And liquor flows
You might also like
I've been drinkin' more
'Cause you're lovin' me less",2015
